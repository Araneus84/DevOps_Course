# DevOps Project: Initial Setup and Dockerization

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains the foundational elements for a DevOps project, focusing on containerization with Docker. The initial phase involves building a Docker image and running it using `docker-compose`. As the project evolves, this README will be updated to reflect new stages, technologies, and functionalities.

---

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
    * [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* **Docker Engine:** For building and running Docker containers.
    * [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

You can verify your Docker installation by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

### Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get your initial Docker image built and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Navigate to your desired directory and clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-folder-name>
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    From the root of your project directory (where `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` are located), build your Docker image. Replace `<your-image-name>` with a meaningful name for your image (e.g., `my-app-image`, `devops-web-app`).

    ```bash
    docker build -t <your-image-name> .
    ```

3.  **Verify the Docker Image:**
    Confirm that your newly built image is listed:

    ```bash
    docker images
    ```
    You should see an entry for `<your-image-name>`.

4.  **Configure `docker-compose.yaml`:**
    Open the `docker-compose.yaml` file in your project directory. Locate the `image:` line for your service and update it to use the image you just built.

    **Before (Example):**
    ```yaml
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "80:80"
        # image: some-base-image # This line might be commented out or different
    ```

    **After (Example):**
    ```yaml
    services:
      web:
        # build: . # You can comment this out or remove it if you always build manually
        ports:
          - "80:80"
        image: <your-image-name> # <--- Update this line
    ```
    *Replace `<your-image-name>` with the exact name you used in step 2.*

5.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    Start your application using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

6.  **Verify Running Containers:**
    Check that your container(s) are running:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

As the project progresses, we plan to integrate and expand upon the following areas:

* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implementing automated build, test, and deployment workflows.
* **Container Orchestration:** Exploring tools like Kubernetes for managing containerized applications at scale.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Setting up solutions for observing application health and performance.
* **Configuration Management:** Automating server and application configuration.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Defining infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
* **Security Best Practices:** Incorporating security measures throughout the DevOps lifecycle.
* **<Add specific features/technologies you plan to implement>**
